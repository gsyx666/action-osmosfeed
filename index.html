Although I don&#x27;t have that much of professional work experience, I&#x60;ve done a few projects that verifies my skills.
The question is how can I start my freelance career(or corporate career) giving that internship opportunities hardly exist in my country (Egypt) and nearly everyone want seniors with 5+ yrs. It&#x60;s really disappointing.</span>

How is technology changing the way salespeople do business?  What are the unseen consequences in sales or business if salespersons do not adapt to the Fourth Industrial Revolution? Like many other industries, the world of sales and marketing is experiencing a significant change - ‘tectonic shifts. Thanks to the cutting edge digital infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence (one of the advances of the Fourth Industrial Revolution) has a global footprint, I.e. in every industry.

Welcome to the AWS open source newsletter #114. This weeks new open source projects feature a variety of community related projects such as &quot;instance-scheduler&quot; a tool to help you schedule AWS resources, &quot;libaws&quot; an opinionated tool that helps you simplify creation and deletion of some AWS resources, &quot;elasticspot&quot; a nice tool to help you reassign elastic IPs, and &quot;auto-close-aws-accounts&quot; that allows you to close AWS accounts if you are using AWS Organisations. We have plenty of other projects such as &quot;amazon-ec2-spot-interrupter&quot; a nice tool that provides a command line tool to trigger spot interruption notifications, and others that help you work with AWS Glue, simplify deployments of SageMaker notebooks, and others.

                              <span>Microsoft Build 2022 has just closed its virtual doors, with a lot of new services and features, and this time around a lot has been said also about DevOps.
Today I’m going to recap all the most important announcements around DevOps made by Microsoft at Build 2002
As usual, if you are a visual learner, or simply prefer to watch and listen instead of reading, here you have the video with the whole explanation and demo, which to be fair is much more complete than this post.

If you rather prefer reading, well... let&#x27;s just continue :)
Let’s start not with an announcement but rather with a lack thereof, with the great absent at Build 2022: I’m talking about Azure DevOps.

To me, Everything started with this Twitter thread and from that article, by Ben Kehoe:
 
When dealing with CLI or SDKs, we are already used to putting IAM credentials in the .aws/credentials file.
However, as correctly stated cluttering the credentials file with many credentials is not the right move to make.
This article aims to overview what IAM Principals are and the better ways to manage your programmatic access to AWS.
Moreover, we&#x27;ll focus on the Credential Process. We&#x27;ll see that we can polish our local usage of AWS Principals with it.
Let&#x27;s dig into this journey through AWS authorization systems.
Stating the official documentation: &quot;A principal is a person or application that can request an action or o…</span>

I recently got a notification about my 5 years on dev.to. It hit me really hard, as I was not active here once I switched careers from scientist to software engineer. 
Back then, dev.to was a startup, I was amidst going from being a Technology Wizard at a high tech perovskite solar cell technology company towards my own startup, which is kinda in zombie state now - we did invent smart functional materials that can be used for a Black Panther suit, amongst other things. 
Some year later, I was freelancing and looking for a job. 3 and a half years ago, landed my current job. Now - I&#x27;m here.
Whats your story?</span>

                              <span>Time estimation in software engineering seems to be the most difficult task.
Time estimation becomes a bit easier for well-managed projects where most of the design decisions have been made and there is enough internal tooling and resources. But it is still not perfect. Things become more difficult for teams with limited resources and external pressure on deadlines. More often than not, the projects get delivered, some more polished than others.
When it comes to time estimation, solo developers working on their side projects face a real challenge. It becomes worse if there is no external motivation or revenue potential for the project. Building something for fun or learning might end up in an unfinished project that never sees a launch day.
Side projects should be straightforward by design…</span>

                              <span>what should I know before learning Java


Well, it doesn’t really matter at all , if you’re interested enough you can directly give it a start with java . However having a prior knowledge of basic OOP’s concepts and a little programming experience(or basic programming concepts) would help you to understand it better and make it easier . Though not mandatory , but to have a strong grip over the concepts before switching to java you can go with C/ C++ ( suggesting as I started with C++ and it has helped me a lot to understand java better)

I am also a java learner but i would like to answer your question. Here all important tips are already given but i want to add only one more point which is much important. 
If you are a beginner, please don&#x27;t use any kind of IDE.
 IDE is specially made for those who already a pretty decent experienced in programming. 
It is helpful for them who are in a very big project development. I would recommend to use notepad and command prompt as a beginner. 
As using this you have nothing to help you except the internet articles. 
So you can rectify your error yourself. In this way you have gain also a decent experience while learning. 
This learning method is slow but very effective. 
Although you have to use IDE in your future but you will have a good ability to rectify your mistakes. 
You can gain a good idea of what type error comes for what kind of mistakes.

Error Lens
CSS Peek
GitLens
Import Cost
Version Lens
Error Lens is an extension which allows you to see error, warning and diagnostic messages in line with your code without having to hover or click on anything! It also highlights the line with different colors to help you better visualize and differentiate between errors, warnings and other messages!

With this extension, you can search for relevant CSS files by using CSS classes in html file and edit CSS files there itself! Here&#x27;s how it works:

GitLens is a powerful extension which can display when a particular line was committed, by whom it was committed and in which pull request it was included along with the commit message! All of this information is inline with the line upon which your cursor is currently located.
You can also hover over the message to get even more information about a particular line of code!


There are many more features in GitLens which you can explore and play around with!
Import Cost allows us to see the size of the imported package inline in the editor itself!

Version Lens fetches information about dependency versions and displays it on top of the package!

These were the 5 VSCode extensions which are powerful, useful and can improve your productivity and workflow!
